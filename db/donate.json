    "content": "<p>The Distinguished Hall of Fame is a 501(c)3 non-profit corporation registered with the IRS and the State of New Jersey formed to recognize alumni who have distinguished themselves in a variety of endeavors, thus providing positive role models for current APHS students. Virtually all the money we receive goes to the students. Our only expenses are mailing, postage, corporate & accounting. A real impact has been made by past Hall of Fame inductees who shared their life stories with students, including the personal and financial hardships they often had to overcome before finally reaching their goals. We have, to date, given a total of $177,000  to a total of 173 students over the past 20 years. We firmly believe that what we have done and what we continue to do has helped the resurgence of the City of Asbury Park, the health of its school system and the stability of the local community. Should you wish to share in the opportunity of our scholarship efforts for worthy APHS students, please complete this donation page and send it with your check to the address provided.</p>"
