    "biography": "<p>Nearly 45 years have sped by since Frank Budd''s graduation form Asbury Park High School, but to those who were fortunate enough to have been witnesses to all the wondrous feats he achieved for Asbury Park High, it likely seems just a few yesterdays ago.</p><p>Yes, speed is the word. No one ever sped through high school competition the way Frank Budd did for the Blue Bishops.</p><p>On the cinderpaths of the day - the elegant, state-of-the-art rubberized ovals of today would have been considered science fiction - Frank Budd ran away from everyone foolish enough to put him to the test. As a proud Asbury Park high School athlete, he was the best at the Shore, the best in the state, the best in America.</p><p>That''s talking track and field, but Frank was a heck of a performer for Asbury Park High in football and basketball, as well.</p><p>With the cheers of his hometown still ringing in his ears, Frank Budd headed for Villanova University in the fall of 1958. He''d had a great track coach at APHS in Nick Merli. Now he was in the hands of another great track coach at Villanova, James \"Jumbo\" Elliott.</p><p>Villanova and Frank Budd - quickly, of course - proved perfect together. Wildcat track teams of the 1959-62 era were devastating and honors piled up. Wherever these Villanovans traveled - the Millrose Games, Penn Relays, IC4A, NCAA and National AAU Championships, and lots more - they proved themselves big-time winners.</p><p>By the summer of 1960, Frank Budd was ready to take on the world. Still not close to his peak years, he ran to a spot on the USA Olympic Team and placed fifth in the 100-meter final at the Rome Olympic Games. Oh, how close that race was. All of 18/100ths of a second separated the first six finishers.</p><p>He seemed destined to win a gold medal in the 4x100-meter sprint relay at Rome but the script didn''t work out as planned. Frank ran a brilliant lead-off leg but No. 2 man Ray Norton started too soon and wound up taking the baton out of the zone. The USA did finish first, ahead of West Germany, and in time that would have set a world record, only to suffer a DQ call.</p><p>Less that one year later, they got to call Frank Budd a world record-breaker and this one was official. It was June 24, 1961, when he won the 100-yard dash at the National AAU Championships at Randalls Island Stadium, New York City in the startling time of 9.2 seconds. He ran in the beaten-up inside lane, too. The listed record of 9.3 was first set by USC''s Mell Patton in 1948, then equaled by an array of others.</p><p>On May 5, 1962 - just before his graduation from Villanova - he added a share of the world record for the 220-yard dash on a straightaway course. He did it on his home track at Villanova and it was an eye-opening 20 seconds flat.</p><p>This, of course, was the era of strict amateurism. Had there been a professional track circuit - the way there is now, often making millionaires of world record-breakers - he almost surely would have stayed in track and pointed to the 1964 Olympic Games.</p><p>Instead, Frank Budd looked for other fields to conquer. Even though he hadn''t played football since high school, he turned to pro football and put his incredible speed to use for the NFL''s Philadelphia Eagles and Washington Redskins before heading north to continue his career for three seasons with the CFL''s Calgary Stampeders.</p><p>He came back to New Jersey, holding positions with the New Jersey Department of Corrections and Atlantic City''s Tropicana Casino, while also serving in a variety of civic and community activities. These days, Frank and his family live in Mount Laurel.</p><p>Just as you''d expect, the honors collected by this man, who traveled the world, who proved himself an All-American runner, and who was cheered as the \"The World''s Fastest Human,\" have piled up over the years. The New Jersey Sportswriters Association welcomed Frank Budd to its Hall of Fame in 1995, and at the end of 1999, the Asbury Park Press named Frank Budd its area \"Athlete Of The Century.\"</p><p>Now, Asbury Park School welcomes Frank Budd as a charter member of its Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame. He''s always felt immense pride in serving as Asbury Park''s athletic ambassador to the world. Now it''s time for Asbury Park to say \"truly well done, Frank, truly well done.\"</p><p>(written by Elliott Denman)</p>",

He was respected, admired and well-liked by colleagues, associates and former political rivals. His family and close friends are inspired by his wit, good nature, character, charisma and kindness.</p><p>Born and raised in Spring Lake, New Jersey, Ben and his older brother, Clyde, learned the importance of public service through their father''s example. Their father, Benjamin S. Danskin, was a realtor with Horatio Clayton Real Estate and Insurance, which he later bought and named the Danskin Agency. Successful in business, Benjamin S. Danskin also succeeded in the public arena. He served as the Secretary of the State Division of Tax Appeals, President of the New Jersey Association of Tax Commissioners, and Deputy Director of Taxation, assisting in the creation of the state tax equalization program. Government service would become a family trait.</p><p>In September 1943, young Ben Danskin joined the Army as a Lieutenant and began training to become a B-25 bomber pilot. When World War II ended, Ben enrolled in the Dickinson College to pursue a degree in political science. He graduated in 1949 and moved back to Wall Township with his wife, Betty Joan Slockbower Danskin (also Class of ’43), who had been his high school sweetheart. Ben and Joan were married for more than 51 years and were the proud parents of three loving daughters: Cathy, Nancy, and Barbara.</p><p>Upon his return from the war, Ben immediately invested himself in his community and embarked upon a life-long commitment to distinguished public service. He joined his father at the Danskin Agency and was elected to the Wall Township Committee. At the age of 27, Ben was appointed as the Mayor of Wall Township, the youngest mayor in township history. In 1963, Ben Danskin was elected as a Monmouth County Freeholder and he served as such until 1969 when he was elected to a five-year term as the Monmouth County Clerk. He was appointed to his first three-year term as Monmouth County Treasurer in 1974. He was reappointed in 1977, replaced by a Democratic Freeholder majority in 1980, but reappointed to the treasurer''s post in 1983, once the GOP regained the majority on the board. In December 2004, Ben Danskin stepped down from the position of Monmouth County Treasurer after 21 years of consecutive service.   From 1969 to 1982, Ben Danskin led the Monmouth County Republican Committee as its Chairman, and remained influential in the party throughout his illustrious career. A genuine leader, Ben Danskin helped launch critical county initiatives and shape public policy through thoughtful, substantive persuasion, and was sought out for his wise counsel and advice.</p><p>Though he would never like it discussed, there are lasting tributes to Ben Danskin''s hard work and public service. He is credited with a leading role in the establishment of Brookdale Community College, the creation of the Monmouth County Correctional Institution, and the expansion of the Monmouth County Park System, just to name a few. Ten of thousands of Monmouth residents continue to benefit from the programs Ben Danskin helped conceive and nurture during his years of public service.</p><p>On the business side, Ben counted his co-founding of Allaire Community Bank in 1996 as one of his most successful endeavors. The bank thrived and was recently bought out by Central Jersey Bank.

    "biography": "<p>I had an academic scholarship to Rutgers, but it was not enough to reside on campus so for the first two years I commuted from home. Early in my junior year I tried out and made the Rutgers baseball team, eventually playing center field and pitching. The coach arranged a baseball scholarship, so I was able to live most of the last two years at the school, saving a daily three hour commute.</p><p>During the summer after graduation, at the Wonder Bar food concession on the Asbury oceanfront, I hired Gail, an 18 year old college sophomore beauty visiting from Philadelphia. After working together for 7 days we announced our soon-to- be wedding. In Sept. we went off to the Univ. of Pittsburgh, she to continue as an undergraduate, me to start medical school.</p><p>My senior year letter of recommendation was written by the no nonsense, very brilliant Jack Myers, M.D., Chief of Medicine and President of the Amer. Col. of Physicians. He wrote I probably was smart enough, but certainly had the compassion in my heart, to be a good doctor. I hope I’ve never let him down. Internship was in San Francisco and on arriving there, now with two babies, our old car fell apart. One year later we were off to a remote southwest Indian reservation, 45 miles to the closest small town, for a two year commitment as a doctor in the U.S. Public Health Service. I can’t remember so well the 200 babies I delivered, but I remember very well the two I lost. A doctor has his own private cemetery.</p><p>Then back to California for two more year’s specialty training and we had a 3rd child. I practiced Internal Medicine for almost 40 years, my wife working with me for most of the years and my daughter the last 17. I never sent a patient to a collection agency, never hassled anyone about a bill, made 3,000 house calls, volunteered for 12 years at our high school as the doctor and watched at least 200 doctor-in- attendance-required football games. I retired on the day of my 70th birthday.</p><p>I then worked with four doctors to start the Santa Rosa Free Medical Clinic, 3½ years ago. We’re all volunteers, the clinic supported by contributions, and all medical care, lab tests, X Rays and medicines are 100% free. I am the Monday doctor. Soon we will have seen 10,000 patients, from as far away as 100 miles. Our organization is being used as a template for other clinics to start a similar program in northern and central California. We do not need any government money.</p><p>Gail and I have a fully trained, California licensed, \"Comfort Dog.\" She’s been in helicopters and fire engines at the scenes of tragedy and disaster. In the recent Oct. 2017 massive Santa Rosa fire, where 6000 homes and businesses were destroyed, she proved her worth to children who lost their home and to some of the 11,000 firefighters who were holding the fire line around our city.</p><p>At age 60 I again picked up a baseball, playing in the 12 team, over age 60 division, in the 700 member Northern California Baseball League. From baseball I needed at different times two shoulder operations, an operation to have a plate placed in the back of my broken hand, a knee operation, 4 broken fingers, and a broken ankle. But in return I got to pitch in many major league and spring training stadiums, pitch with and against former major league ballplayers, twice voted Most Valuable Player and four times, including this year, Best Pitcher. Our team record this year was 20 wins, no loss.</p><p>The greatest gift I was ever given was Gail, always my kind partner, always my guiding light. My reflection on life: Life is like baseball. You get a chance to be up at the plate. It’s OK to swing and miss, but never let it be that you are called \"Out\" by keeping the bat on your shoulder and taking, but not swinging, at what will be the 3rd strike. Swing away.</p>",

As you’d expect of the son of one of the original Blocks of Granite who played for Fordham University, Wojie and his Pop-Pop followed their shared passion for football. A high school friend remembers him as a fierce competitor!  He was \"the hardest hitter on the team.\"  But sports were only one of Wojie’s many loves. Whether it was ballooning, fishing, flying, skiing, travel or scuba diving, it didn’t matter to him as long as he was challenged and doing what he loved.  Wherever he was and whatever he was doing, he is always surrounded by family and friends.</p><p>Born on August 19, 1938 to Katherine (nee Mallen) and Alexander Frances Wojciechowicz, Sr., Wojie spent his childhood growing up with gusto along with his siblings. He attended Wanamassa grade school and Asbury Park High School, where his athleticism gave his alma mater many pages in the local newspapers.  He graduated from Asbury Park High School in 1956 and, after a gap year at The Lawrenceville School, he headed to Princeton University.  It was during his sophomore year at college that Wojie found another love, a perky girl named Carol in a Cadillac convertible who became his soul mate and partner in crime.</p><p>From the gridiron to the classroom, Wojie was a competitor. He received a degree in aeronautical engineering from Princeton and then on to Rutgers University for a Master’s degree in electrical engineering. He was a real rocket scientist and went to work for The Hercules Powder Company making solid-fuel rocket motors supplying the United States military as well as NASA.</p><p>Next Wojie started his own business, Alto, which originally made insulators for high voltage electricity distribution grids. But fate decided that they would change what they did. An avid boater, Wojie had a bad accident where he lost part of his finger.  Dr. Carroll from New York was able to save most of the finger but most importantly while he was being treated, the doctor told him about colleagues who needed help designing devices to help make hearts function correctly. This was a challenge worthy of Wojie and Alto began developing the first of many life-saving instruments.</p><p>Alexander Frances Wojciechowicz lived a robust life, loving his wife Carol and his children with the gusto that was his hallmark.  He was taken from his family and friends too soon but not before he touched many lives and made his hometown proud. </p>",

While attending APHS, he met Joe Major, Raymond Morris, and Willie Penna , members of a local singing group. They recruited Lenny to be their lead singer. In a short time, the group got gigs around town, calling themselves The Markeys.</p><p>Lenny decided to try to become a solo singer and moved to New York City to pursue his career. After several years, at age nineteen, he met Archie Bleyer, conductor on the Arthur Godfrey Show, who signed Lenny to Cadence Records. Lenny''s recording of \"Since I Fell For You\" on Cadence in 1964 became one of the nation''s biggest hits, selling over a million copies. His other hits include \"You Don''t Know Me\", \"Ebb Tide\", which was featured in the film \"Sweet Bird of Youth\", \"Breaking Up Is Hard To Do\", and \"Two Different Worlds\". He also recorded the first vocal version of \"A Taste of Honey\".  Lenny''s last Cadence hit was \"If You See My Love\".</p><p>In September 1964, Archie Bleyer decided to close down Cadence and retire. Andy Williams wound up buying the rights to Cadence''s catalogue, including Lenny''s songs. Every six months or so, Lenny receives a check from Andy Williams for \"Since I Fell For You\" which has a knack for turning up on commercials, compilations, and movie sound tracks.</p><p>Lenny went shopping for another record deal. He ended up signing with Kapp Records. He had three hits with Kapp, \"Darling Take Me Back\", \"Two Different Worlds\", and \"Run To My Loving Arms\", but it wasn''t a good fit with Kapp.  Lenny felt nothing was a good fit after Archie Bleyer. Lenny described Archie as a father figure who traveled with him and taught him how to act on TV.</p><p>Lenny has performed in venues throughout Europe, South America, and the Virgin Islands as well as in the US. He has appeared at the Trump Castle in Atlantic City, Radio City Music Hall, The Apollo Theater, Nassau Coliseum, and Caesar''s Palace in Las Vegas.

He has now added a new dimension to his show business career, and that is acting. He made a number of appearances on \"General Hospital\". </p><p>In October 1955, Lenny came full circle when he guested at a benefit concert for Rock and Roll Revival promoter, Richard Nader. Lenny had the pleasure of dueting \"Since I Fell For You\" with his inspiration, Willie Winfield of the legendary Harptones. In November 2011, Lenny had the privilege of returning to his hometown of Asbury Park to perform at the Paramount Theater in a reunion concert featuring the sounds of the West side of Asbury Park.</p><p>Currently, Lenny lives in Los Angeles and finds himself in demand again for Oldies shows. Lenny''s unique style and sound have made him one of the nation''s most respected singers. His fans range all the way from teenagers to senior citizens.

Marlyn was one of his star demonstrators, appearing on “American Bandstand” regularly during a break from college. Being in front of an audience was nothing new to her.</p><p>From her days singing in assemblies at Bangs Avenue School to time spent on stage at Asbury Park High, Marlyn discovered that the performing arts were one of the great equalizers and unifiers. The arts brought people from diverse backgrounds and walks of life together and allowed them to share their talents and experiences.</p><p>After receiving her degree in education from New York University, Marlyn began her teaching career in Long Branch. While working at West End School, she staged an original adaptation of “The Bremen Town Musicians,” which, she wrote, produced and directed. She’d found her calling.</p><p>For over half a century, Marlyn was one of the most recognized children’s theater impresarios in New Jersey while continuing her role as a teacher in the Ocean Township School System and later at The Hillel School of the Shore Area; simultaneously working as a tutor, vocal and acting coach, sales demonstrator, and part-time reporter for The Asbury Park Press, where she covered local government.</p><p>Generations of kids throughout Monmouth County got their chance to shine on stage through Marlyn’s productions, which were staged at Ocean Township’s Summer Showcase Musical Theater, which she co-founded, the JCC of the Jersey Shore and the Axelrod Performing Arts Center, where she is currently a board member. Many of the young performers she trained eventually went on to become professional actors, singers and dancers in regional theater, on Broadway, in television and film. And many, at one time or another, have acknowledged her as being their inspiration and biggest fan. One of the great pleasures she takes to this day, is running into former students and performers, some with children and grandchildren of their own who credit their introduction to the arts to Marlyn.</p><p>Now retired from producing and promoting her shows, Marlyn still enjoys attending theater and concerts, as well as sharing good times with her sons and their families.</p>",

It was his good fortune to have found positive male role models through his mentors at the Asbury Park Boys’ Club, his teachers and coaches at A.P.H.S., and later at the University of Maryland, his beloved Coach James Kehoe. After stepping into his calling as Head Boys Track & Field Coach in 1968, he would spend his adult years paying it forward to the young men of Neptune High School. His athletes ranked with the very best and collected major honors. What mattered most to him was not the achievement of team titles, but that every athlete, not just those bearing titles, put forth their best effort to be the best they could be and as their coach saw to it that they obtain scholarship assistance and attend college.</p><p>Hank helped mold Shore Track into what it is today, in every aspect of the sport. After he and Kenny O’Donnell created the Shore Coaches Association, he saw the need for track coaches to form their own association, so he with Ed Scullion created the Shore Track & Field Association, which began the sophisticated large-scale present-day X-country and track & field competitions. He implemented the use of the automatic timing system which changed the blueprint for the future of track. In 1986 the National Federation of Active Coaches honored him with the High School Distinguished National Coach Award. After retiring from coaching, he became State Rules Interpreter and a Top Shore Referee who has yet to be replaced.</p><p><em>\"The greatest compliment I could give Hank about his coaching is that he coached. By that I mean he prepared his athletes for competition and life. He didn’t just put the time in; he worked and worked hard.

He did the right things . . . he cared; there were never any promises to do something that he didn’t carry out. He was a worker who did his job. He was the only person our age that wasn’t looking forward to retirement. He loved what he was doing and he was the best at it.
