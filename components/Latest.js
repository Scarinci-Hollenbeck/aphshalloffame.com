      <p>
      Welcome to the Asbury Park High School Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame.  Part of our mission is to recognize and honor those APHS graduates who have used the skills and knowledge which they acquired in the High School to become “Distinguished” adults in many different and varied fields.  Another and equally important portion of our mission is to instill in the current APHS students a feeling that they too can be successful adults irrespective of their often difficult backgrounds.  A part of that task is for us to install a plaque in the hallway of the high school displaying a photo of the inductee together with a brief description of their accomplishments so that the current students can actually visualize who was inducted and why.
