        Asbury Park High School has a rich history of graduating students who
        have played a meaningful role in our society. The Asbury Park High
        School Distinguished Alumni Hall of Fame seeks to recognize the
        accomplishments of these graduates.
      </p>
      <p>
        A candidate for admission into the Hall of Fame must have distinguished
        himself or herself in their chosen field of endeavor. A candidate must
        be a role model for current high school students.
      </p>
      <p>
        The selection committee will give particular emphasis to a
        candidate&apos;s public service and to the contributions the candidate
        has made to society.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that another portion of our mission is to aid current APHS
        students in achieving their higher education goals by helping to supply
        the financial aid which they so desperately need.
