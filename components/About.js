        In the late 90&apos;s, Carl Williams, Mayor of Asbury Park and graduate
        of Asbury Park High School, conceived of a vehicle where the rich
        history of the high school and its graduates would be remembered and
        celebrated. Carl also saw this as an opportunity to introduce
        outstanding graduates to current high school students, enabling the
        students to observe first hand that success was indeed possible
        regardless of how difficult their backgrounds may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mayor Williams enlisted his friend, Judge Ira Kreizman, also an APHS
        graduate, and together they formed a committee to make Carl&apos;s dream
        a reality. The initial committee consisted of Williams and Kreizman,
        Sandy Armstead, the late Gladys Johnson, Henry Johnson, Oliver Jones,
        Janice Davis Keener, Lorraine Hartigan Nonnenberg, and Myrna Wright, the
        Parent/Community Coordinator at APHS. After all of the legal and
        accounting requirements for a non-profit corporation were met, and
        criteria for induction was determined, the first group of Hall of Famers
        was selected. The initial group was inducted on 4/11/03 before a sold
        out crowd at the Berkeley Carteret Hotel in Asbury Park. Earlier that
        day, many of the inductees met with students at the high school, sharing
        their paths to success.

        Each inductee into the Asbury Park High School Distinguished Alumni Hall
        of Fame is honored with a plaque featuring a photo and brief career
        highlights. The plaques are mounted in the main corridor of the high
        school where they can be viewed by present day students who will
        hopefully be encouraged to emulate the success of prior students who
        came from similar backgrounds and overcame similar hardships.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 2005, the committee expanded to include Alan McKean, Sharon Brown,
        Thomas DeSeno, Remo Strada, and Stanley Smith. Unfortunately, one of the
        charter members, Gladys Johnson, passed away on 1/17/05. The journal was
        dedicated to her memory recognizing her tremendous contribution to the
        APHS Hall of Fame.

        Nineteen alumni were inducted on 4/22/05, once again at the Berkeley
        Carteret Hotel. Included in the group of inductees was the late Leon
        Hess, founder of Amerada Hess and owner of the N.Y. Jets, who graduated
        from APHS in 1931.

        In 2007, Marilyn Higginbothan Tomaino and Rita Abbott Abrams joined the
        committee. Fourteen new honorees were inducted into the Hall of Fame in
        ceremonies held at Branches in West Long Branch, while the Berkeley was
        undergoing renovations.{' '}

        A generous contribution from the Hess Foundation and Norma Wilentz Hess,
        widow of Leon Hess, gave the committee the ability to provide college
        scholarships to Asbury Park High School graduates. Scholarships were
        awarded each year from 2007.

        Paul Chaiet joined the Hall of Fame committee in 2009. Thirteen new
        honorees were inducted into the Hall of Fame during ceremonies held on
        5/21/10, once again, at the Berkeley. The induction ceremony was
        dedicated to the memory of Norma Hess who unfortunately passed away in
        2010.

        In 2012 we inducted 13 more distinguished alumni in a ceremony
        highlighted by the performance of gold record recording star Lenny
        Welch, accompanied by Grammy Award winning composer and musician, John
        Colby ,APHS,Class of 67.
